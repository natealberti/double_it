# double_it
Takes an integer and doubles it

Simple assembly program for class that takes an integer (supposed to be between 30 and 40), and doubles it. All of the output is done through the console. Instead of using utils.asm, this was made to enphasize the creation of my own methods, or subprograms, to complete the project.
